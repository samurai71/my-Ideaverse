Ideaverse Pro empowers you to learn faster, remember more, and have a system that turns random "stuff" into valuable "things".

### How is this different than Ideaverse Lite?
Ideaverse Pro is the gold standard version, with all the latest and greatest features, and everything you need for an immediately useable ideaverse.

### What should I expect out of Ideaverse Pro?
Ideaverse Pro empowers you to organize intuitively, remember more, and have a system that turns random "stuff" into valuable "things". Along with the two downloadable vaults, if you are brand new to Ideaverse, you'll also receive the six-part Ideaverse professional-grade email course.

### Ideaverse Pro includes the following:
- Access to the Ideaverse Pro vault with full workflows, PKM structuring, and more.
- Mini-course, recordings, and documentation in Circle (üìçyou are here).
- Access to the Ideaverse Zero starter vault.
- Access to all lessons and updates for 12 months.

### What shouldn't I expect out of Ideaverse Pro?

Ideaverse Pro explores both foundations and advanced systems in knowledge management.
