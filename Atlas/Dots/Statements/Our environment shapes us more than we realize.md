Our environment shapes us more than we realize, even when we realize how much our environment shapes us.

That's why I care so much about putting intention into my thinking spaces like Obsidian.

I want to make sure that when I enter the app, something is activated within me so I can be my best self and realize my fullest potential of thoughts and creativity.

The way I achieve this is through themes.

Different themes inspire different purposes. There's one for productivity, one for creativity, and one for reflection. Switching between these themes allows us to shift mental contexts as we engage with the different notes in our Ideaverse.

## Examples
Here are some of my favorites:
- [[LYT Mode Theme]]  (evolved from [[Cybertron Theme]])
- Prism Theme (what you're currently seeing)
- Soft Paper Theme, a ["custom theme to feel more reflective"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjpIhYOEw) created by modifying the AnuPpuccin theme
